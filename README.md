# time-execution
A simple Python script that can time how long a script (or section) takes to execute.

Includes start and end functions that can imported in to other scripts to time how long a section or entire script takes to execute.

I wrote this as a exercise to learn about functions and the time module. I appreciate there are better modules that can be used to do achieve this information.
